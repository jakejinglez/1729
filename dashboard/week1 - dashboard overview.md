This is a very important topic in my opinion because while we have a group of extremely talented and vaguely aligned individuals in our discord group, we also have a lot of noise, inactive members, and many people including myself feel that there is no intrinsic sense of community yet. We haven't yet set common goals, we haven't had honest/high-quality communications with each other yet and finally, we have not yet exchanged value.

In lecture 8, I was thinking about what Balaji described as the path he thought would be the most appropriate to build a network state conceptually. This can be roughly illustrated as:

### Course → Community → College → Cryptoeconomy → Crowdfund → City → Country

For the time being Balaji and the 1729 team have gotten the rough outline of the lecture content spot on and over multiple iterations of the 1729 book and lecture cohorts they will have nailed the course part. Since the course serves as a gateway into our community I would prefer it be taught by people who are much better communicators and have a better personal brand outside of 1729 in order to add credibility to the content. Personally, I feel my focus should be on creating the community itself. Now, you might wonder why this task is not trivial, after all, we are all part of the same discord server, aren't we? While that is correct, at best this implies a sense of shared interest i.e. web3. Since we are almost at the end of the lecture series, a few of us realized that we need to have a sense of shared achievement from shared efforts in order to build a cohesive community.

After thinking for a long time, we realized that we needed to build a community dashboard ASAP in order to prevent the enthusiasm in the community from fizzling out. But what was more important to us was to articulate the contents of the dashboard itself. In the spirit of the agile methodology, we have decided to split the long term goal of this dashboard into 4 stages, where each stage has a modular focus:

1.  **v1:** focus on building a sense of shared
2.  **v2:** add more community progress indicators and allow for tunable dashboard metrics using on-chain activity and facilitate on-chain collaboration using cryptouniversity credential NFTs
3.  **v3:** add more community progress indicators and allow the community to exchange value in a P2P manner using native network state tokens
4.  **v4:** completely migrate the community to a web3 platform for complete censorship resistance

### Features:

In the following 4 weeks, I will be spending time journalling the technical and design intricacies of each and every feature that will be a part of v1 of the dashboard in detail. In terms of the reasoning behind choosing which features will be a part of the v1 dashboard, we wanted to focus on a few things in particular: **in-community discoverability, in-community clout, community progress indication, and community objectives.**

-   **In-community discoverability:** In order to ease collaboration and high impact communication (possibly leading to niche formation) amongst 1729 members, there needs to be an indexed and searchable directory of all the community members that can allow for discoverability on the basis of current engagement, readings that drive them, original writings, and funding initiatives they manage. This can lead to greater alignment in the short term and allow members to discover synergies. (which is one of the major things we feel is missing from the group). For now, we want to take keywords from people's pinned tweets Twitter bio, discord intro on reception, content shared with #writers on discord. ***PS:** Later we want to have an option to add this content manually as well because we are well aware of why people would not want to link their public-facing identities to 1729.*

-   **Community Progress:** In order to cement the idea of shared and personal progress on a metric that the 1729 network state aligns itself with, we need to create a time-series view of how each individual is performing on the proof of workout metric along with a separate view that captures how well the community as a whole is performing in terms of improving the overall health of the community. This will take some work since workouts are a very analog thing for the most part.

-   **Community Objectives:** We need to build a queryable version of a Decentralized Tech Tree using smart contracts that can be best visualized as a directional acyclic graph where each node is an objective and contains a certain value locked behind it. For the time being, if multiple proposals seek the reward for an objective, we have to rely on the node creator to allot the prize fairly. Later on, we can create a "multiparty result attribution algorithm" to automate this procedure of releasing rewards and make it overall more objective.

-   **In-community clout:** We want to be able to rank community members on a range of metrics such as meaningful interactions(length of threads), contribution to community objectives (value locked in the Decentralized Tech Tree), involvement in community objectives (value gained from completing Decentralized Tech Tree tasks), lecture attendance, and other novel contributions that are rewarded with POAPs. We need there to be an NFT showcase that is part of the profile page and also a filterable/orderable member list and the condensed values for all these metrics on the community page.

### Why these features?

While I have made an effort to elucidate what the features will look like, I feel it is essential to convince non-contributors of each of the four components we have chosen for the v1 dashboard in building a solid community.

-   **In-community discoverability:** While we would like everyone to be equally involved, contributing, and engaged with all the other members of the community, it is not pragmatic to expect from everyone so on a regular basis. A more natural version of the dynamic is to imagine the community as a collection of niches / sub-interest groups. In my own example, I find that of the 660 members in 1729, 99% of my conversations have been with just 10 members in the group. *This may result from a combination of multiple factors (including the inability to appreciate things I do not completely understand or "rate"), but mainly because there is a limit on my personal bandwidth of attention, retention, and reciprocation.* And having managed a much more vertically aligned and centralized community in my college of around 150 people for 2 years, I have seen similar occurrences. Thus, I believe this is a part of all communities especially open-ended ones like 1729 where people have widely varying buy-ins, expectations, and objectives. I want 1729 to be a more efficient community which can only be achieved by focusing on member synergy and community cohesion via member discoverability.

An important means of maintaining community/societal cohesion, trust, and unity lies in the long-term relies on fulfilling the following 3 conditions: *a shared sense of progress, the ability to articulate your contribution to the progress and a feeling that you are being fairly compensated for your contributions.*

-   **Community Progress:** In solving the first of the above 3 features, we need to first be able to quantifiably state that we are headed in the right direction to fulfilling our destiny. For instance, 1729 has a three-part motto "truth, health, wealth" so we need to be able to measure how well the individual and the community are performing on each of these metrics using relevant proxies such as proof of learning, proof of workout, and so on. The transparent recording and displaying of these metrics on-chain allow for people to formulate competing models to remedy unfortunate predicaments along any of these axes. The side-benefit of this approach is that the room for bad faith discussions and unfounded accusations is greatly reduced because propositions become modular, outcome-oriented, and permanently associated (via on-chain ledger) with your credibility.

-   **Community Objectives:** We want to be able to decide what problems we need to solve as a network state, and it makes sense to allow people to create nodes (that ideally represent atomic tasks) that all link up to form a sort of roadmap for community objectives. Now, how do we know we are working on the right problems? Of course, there is no one right answer to this but I feel whoever has the biggest commitment/alignment/investment into the network state should have a greater amount of stake in deciding the direction in which the community can direct its efforts. However, since the objectives graph is decentralized, it is very likely and hopefully expected that we will have multiple parallel roadmaps with value locked in it.

-   **In-community clout:** People are easily addicted to playing social status games intrinsically (or in the words of the great investor Charlie Munger, "People act in response to incentives") and we can use this philosophy to optimize any on-chain or in-group parameters that are appropriate proxies for positive behaviors we want community members to inculcate. While the top members will automatically excel on these metrics, people who are losing interest or beginning to fall behind will know where there is a scope for improvement and can be driven by FOMO into working to improve their individual performance on these metrics.

### v1 Wireframes

Just a basic wireframe of what the dashboard might look like:

**PS:** Of course treat this as a live wireframe that will evolve as I think about each feature in much greater detail

### Tech Stack

We have not settled on the frontend framework yet, however, we have decided that the backend shall be made using flask for absolutely no reason at all apart from the fact that it is a lightweight backend library that is extremely customizable and will allow for quick customizability and modularity.
